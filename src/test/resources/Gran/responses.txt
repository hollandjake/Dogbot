Eat your greens!
Oh my how you've grown since I last saw you
Mommy knows a lot, but Grandma knows everything!
A garden of Love grows in a Grandmother’s heart
There’s no place like home... except Grandma’s
You are what grandmother’s dreams are made of
God couldn’t be everywhere, so he created grandmothers
Grammy says I put the twinkle in her eyes
Grandmas never run out of hugs or cookies
Look out you don't get your chooky bird stuck in a zipper!
You were so cute when you were younger. What happened?
What's a semi?
